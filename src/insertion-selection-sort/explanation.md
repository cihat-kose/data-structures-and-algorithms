# Insertion and Selection Sort

## Insertion Sort

Given the array **[22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]**, the steps for insertion sort are as follows:

1. [16, 22, 27, 2, 18, 6]
2. [2, 16, 22, 27, 18, 6]
3. [2, 16, 18, 22, 27, 6]
4. [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27] -> Final

### Big-O Analysis

- Worst case: **O(n²)**
- Best case: **O(n)**

## Selection Sort

Given the array **[7, 3, 5, 8, 2, 9, 4, 15, 6]**, the steps for selection sort are as follows:

1. [2, 3, 5, 8, 7, 9, 4, 15, 6]
2. [2, 3, 4, 8, 7, 9, 5, 15, 6]
3. [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 8, 15, 6] -> Final
