# Merge Sort

## Steps

Given the array **[16, 21, 11, 8, 12, 22]**, the steps for merge sort are:

1. Split into subarrays: [16, 21, 11] [8, 12, 22]
2. Split further: [16] [21, 11] [8, 12] [22]
3. Sort subarrays: [11, 16, 21] [8, 12, 22]
4. Merge sorted arrays: [8, 11, 12, 16, 21, 22]

### Big-O Analysis

- Worst case: **O(n log n)**
- Best case: **O(n log n)**
